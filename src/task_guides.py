**CRITICAL: You MUST output your final result in JSON format wrapped with <Output>...</Output> tags. Do NOT output plain text analysis as the final result.**

## 1. Understand the Task
What should be analyzed in the task.
List the objects within the target function should be analyzed base on the specific task, such as args, vars, func name, etc.

2. Inspect the Calling Context
Describe the calling relationship of the functions.
If a function in context is a library function, describe its functionality and definition (including arguments and return type).

3. Callsites Analysis
Analyze each caller of the target function, describing each argument passed into the target function.
Analyze each callsite within the target function, describing the arguments passed into each callee function.

4. Analyze Function Semantics
Analyze the behavior of each function, end with detailed analysis of the target function.

5. Data Flow Analysis
Inferring the propagation path of each target variable and argument (cross-function and inter-procedural analysis).

6. Usage Patterns
Summarize the usage patterns of each variable and argument in target function.
Based on the usage patterns, judge if the argument and variable is a complex type, such as struct, enum, array, etc.

7. Type Inference
Infer the type of each argument and variable within target function base on the data flow analysis and usage patterns.
If the type is structure, enum, or array, infer the detailed type information: structure fields, enum list, array length.

8. Name Recovery
Recover the name of each argument and variable within target function base on the analysis above.

9. Return Type Inference
Infer the return type of the target function based on the analysis above.

10. Function Name Recovery
If one context function's name is stripped (e.g., sub_0xFuncAddr), infer the possible function name based on the analysis above.
Infer the possible name for target function based on the analysis above, only when the function name is stripped.

11. Comment Generation
- a. Generate doxygen comments for the whole target function based on the analysis above, including brief, detailed, parameters, return.
- b. Generate inline comments (end of the line) only for the target function to help user understand the code. Only comment on the key lines, such as some callsites, some important variables and usages, beginning of some loops, etc. LESS IS BETTER!

12. Algorithm and Category Analysis
Analyze whether the target function implements a specific algorithm, or is a part of a specific algorithm.
Analyze what category the target function belongs to, such as logging, network, crypto, data processing, etc.
If it is not one of the well-defined ones, or if you are not sure, use "none".

13. Review and Summary
Review the analysis check reasoning process.
Describe the key basis for inferring each result above.

# **关键点和假设:**

# * **PyArmor**: 所有的 PyArmor 保护代码 (如 `__pyarmor_assert_XXXX__`, `__pyarmor_enter_XXXX__`) 都被省略了。
# * **常量字符串**: 模块中的大部分内容是巨大的多行字符串，它们被赋值给不同的变量，如 `func_analysis_guide`, `decompilation_output_format_str` 等。这些字符串详细定义了每个分析任务的步骤和期望的输出格式。
# * **`TASK_GUIDES` 和 `TASK_OUTPUT_FORMATS` 字典**: 这两个字典是模块的核心，它们将任务标签映射到相应的指南和输出格式描述。
# * **`get_mock_response` 函数**:
#     * 它依赖于一个名为 `debug_mock.json` 的文件，该文件应与此脚本位于同一目录。
#     * 函数首先检查该文件是否存在，如果不存在则抛出异常。
#     * 如果文件存在，它会读取并解析这个 JSON 文件。
#     * 字节码中的逻辑暗示，它可以为一个 `task_tag` 提供最多两种不同的模拟响应（通过检查 `task_tag` 和 `task_tag + "2"` 作为键）。如果两者都存在，则随机选择一个。如果只有 `task_tag` 存在，则使用它。
# * **`__file__` 的使用**: 在 `get_mock_response` 中，`os.path.dirname(__file__)` 用于确定 `debug_mock.json` 的路径。在 `<frozen ...>` 环境下（如 PyInstaller 或类似工具打包后），`__file__` 的行为可能与普通 Python 脚本不同，但字节码显示它确实直接使用了 `__file__`。
# * **模块用途**: 这个模块显然是为了给 LLM 提供清晰、结构化的指令，以确保分析结果的一致性和可用性，并且支持一个调试/模拟框架。

# 这个反编译版本应该能很好地反映原始模块的功能和结构。
